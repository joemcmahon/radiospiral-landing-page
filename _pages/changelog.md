# Changelog

<br>

### `Latest` (**Version 2.3.1** ("Bigger Hammer")i â€“ awaiting App Store approval)
- Changes behind the scenes to make reconnecting to the server after a pause or interruption work better.

### Version 2.3
- We've updated the app to properly fetch the metadata from our new broadcasting server, with more timely and accurate metadata updates.
- We now can show you _accurate_ cover images, supplied by our artists. No more Apple Music cover roulette!

### Version 2.2.1
- We've updated the code to work better under newer versions of iOS.
- Updated "share" dialog sends both the artist and the album.
- The bug sometimes caused by being paused "too long" has been fixed. Mostly.
- There are now indicators for live DJ and live performances.
- We've stripped down the "now playing screen" to just artist and track temporarily.
- Now runs on the iPad in split-screen mode.
- Also runs on Mac OS!

### Version 2.1.2
- We skip the station selection page so you can get to the music faster, because _right now_ we only have one station.
- We don't autoplay, though, because we're not monsters.

### Version 2.0
 - Various bug fixes and enhancements. We try to fetch covers from Apple Music where possible. (Sometimes we get funny substitutions; we're working on that!)

### Version 1.1
- Fixed the ordering of fields on the "now playing" screen. Currently also working to make sure the server always sends them.

#### What's New
- We reordered the fields on the "now playing" screen: track on top, artist in the middle, and name or release on the bottom, for live shows and for when we have all three items available from the server. (We're working on making sure the server sends them for all tracks!)
 - The privacy policy reflects your rights under GDPR and CCPA.
#### Bug Fixes
- The "now playing" information looked odd in some cases. We've updated that display to look better.
